When a message rate is exceeded, a user's financial or social stake gets slashed.\n\nIn a p2p setting, this means that each node keeps the necessary state required and validates messages before passing them on.\n\nThis means that we get a decentralized, sybil-resistant and privacy-preserving communication channel in a p2p network.\n\n## Examples\n\n[Waku RLN Relay](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/17/) is an example of using RLNP2P applied to Waku in a GossipSub network.\n\nThe same technique can trivally be used on top of stock libp2p GossipSub as well.\n\nWith some modifications, it can also likely be used in other topologies such as [Dandellion++](https://github.com/vacp2p/research/issues/119) and [Tor/onion routing](https://github.com/vacp2p/research/issues/149).\n\np2p applications that use use RLN on the social layer, as opposed to on the networking layer, can also likely use RLNP2p. For example, [zkchat](https://github.com/kayleegeorge/zk-chat).\n\nWe are also currently working on a variant that combines [RLN+Interrep](https://github.com/vacp2p/research/issues/147), using social stake instead of financial stake. This paves the way for users who do not currently have crypto assets to use RLNP2P.\n\n### Contribute\n\nCheck out links below and join the #rln channel in our [Vac Discord](https://discord.gg/PQFdubGt6d)\n\n## Links\n\n### RLN\n\n- [Rate Limiting Nullifier (PSE)](https://rate-limiting-nullifier.github.io/rln-docs/)\n- [RLN spec (PSE/Vac)](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/32/)\n- [RLN GH org (PSE)](https://github.com/Rate-Limiting-Nullifier)\n- [Zerokit RLN library (Vac)](https://github.com/vacp2p/zerokit/)\n\n### RLN Relay\n\n- [RLN Relay write-up (Vac)](https://vac.dev/rln-relay)\n- [RLN Relay spec (Vac)](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/17/)\n- [RLN Relay testnet (Vac)](https://github.com/status-im/nwaku/blob/master/docs/tutorial/rln-chat-cross-client.md)\n\n### Work in progress\n\n- [RLN+Interrep](https://github.com/vacp2p/research/issues/147)\n- [Waku v2 anonymity roadmap](https://github.com/vacp2p/research/issues/107)\n- [RLNP2P positioning doc](https://github.com/vacp2p/research/issues/146)\n\n### Misc\n\n- [Privacy & Scaling Explorations](https://appliedzkp.org/)\n- [Vac Research](https://vac.dev)","metadata":{"title":"Main"},"toc":[{"content":"RLNP2P","slug":"rlnp2p","lvl":1,"i":0,"seen":0},{"content":"About RLNP2P","slug":"about-rlnp2p","lvl":2,"i":1,"seen":0},{"content":"Examples","slug":"examples","lvl":2,"i":2,"seen":0},{"content":"Contribute","slug":"contribute","lvl":3,"i":3,"seen":0},{"content":"Links","slug":"links","lvl":2,"i":4,"seen":0},{"content":"RLN","slug":"rln","lvl":3,"i":5,"seen":0},{"content":"RLN Relay","slug":"rln-relay","lvl":3,"i":6,"seen":0},{"content":"Work in progress","slug":"work-in-progress","lvl":3,"i":7,"seen":0},{"content":"Misc","slug":"misc","lvl":3,"i":8,"seen":0}]},"navProps":{"metadata":{"published":true,"title":"Main"},"navOrder":-1,"localPath":"rlnp2p.md","path":[],"children":[],"isDir":false},"routeParams":{}},"__N_SSG":true}
